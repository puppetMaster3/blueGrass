Primus API ("we" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Statement describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information through our software, website, documentation, and related services (together, the "Services").

<h2>1. Consent.</h2>
<p>By using the Services, you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Statement.  Except as set forth in this Privacy Statement, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.  We do not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale of such information in a way that specifically identifies the individual (i.e. we don't sell customer lists).  You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time.  However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using some or all of the Services.</p>

<h2>2. Collection of Information.</h2>

When purchasing the Services, we will require you to provide financial and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and number of employees ("<u>Billing Information</u>").

Some of this Data may be stored and maintained on our cloud storage system.  If you run into technical errors in the course of using the Services, we may request your permission to obtain a crash report along with certain logging information from your system documenting the error ("<u>Diagnostic Information</u>").  Such information may contain information regarding your Operating System version, hardware, browser version (and .NET version information in case of Windows systems), and your email address, if provided.

Collectively, this information is referred to as "<u>Analytics Information</u>."</p>

<h2>4. Disclosures & Transfers.</h2>
<p>We have put in place contractual and other organizational safeguards with our agents (see further below) to ensure a proper level of protection of your Personal Information (see further "Security" below).

<p>From time to time we may employ third parties to help us improve the Services.  These third parties may have limited access to databases of user information or registered member information solely for the purpose of helping us to improve the Services and they will be subject to contractual restrictions prohibiting them from using the information about our members for any other purpose.  Such agents or third parties do not have any rights to use Personal Information beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

<h2>5. Important Exceptions.</h2>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of the Services, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities.  We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including any due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Statement by the entity acquiring the information.</p>

<h2>6. Security.</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment.  We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps designed to protect Personal Information that you provide to us.  We have implemented procedures designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only such designated staff as are reasonably necessary to carry out the stated purposes we have communicated to you.</p>

<p>You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information.  For instance, never give out your password, and safeguard your user name, password and personal credentials when you are using the Services, so that other people will not have access to your Personal Information.  Furthermore, you are responsible for maintaining the security of any personal computing device on which you utilize the Services.</p>

<h2>7. Sharing Information with Third Parties.</h2>
<p>You may be able to share information with third parties through use of the Services. The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours.  The use of any information that you may provide to any third parties will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party or by your independent agreement with such third party, as the case may be.  If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing to a third party, we recommend that you contact that third party directly for more information or to review its privacy policy.</p>

<h2>8. Retention.</h2>
<p>We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you.  We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.  All retained Personal Information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Statement.  Please note that if you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all of your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.</p>

<h2>9. Amendment of this Privacy Statement.</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time.  If we decide to change this Privacy Statement in the future, we will post or provide appropriate notice.  Any non-material change (such as clarifications) to this Privacy Statement will become effective on the date the change is posted, and any material changes will become effective 30 days from their posting or via email to your listed email address.  Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Statement applies to all Personal Information that we have about you and your account.  The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the bottom of this document.  We recommend that you print a copy of this Privacy Statement for your reference and revisit this policy from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes.

Upon receipt of your written request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information, although in certain limited circumstances we may not be able to make all relevant information available to you, such as where that information also pertains to another user.  In such circumstances we will provide reasons for the denial to you upon request.  We will endeavor to deal with all requests for access and modifications in a timely manner.</p>

<p>We will make every reasonable effort to keep your Personal Information accurate and up-to-date, and we will provide you with mechanisms to update, correct, delete or add to your Personal Information as appropriate.
