        Primus API is a Cloud API operator that
        provides back end service and database API, enabling you to develop all webapps exclusivity via front end .js.
        You no longer need to learn, setup, deploy or operate back end languages and tools. You can and place your webapp on CDN of your choice.

        And even better, we handle all the security, scalability,
        and guarantee the fastest speed.
        <br/>You just write your HTML5 and use our library for database API (Select, Insert, Update and Delete are the 4, aka CRUD) and more, just do this:
        <pre>
            &ltscript src='http://scdn.primus.netdna-cdn.com/latest/cloudAPI.js'>&lt/script>
        </pre>
        And now would can cloudAPI.insert(...) or cloudAPI.select(...), etc. There is not much more to it, check out our tutorials.
        This way you can focus on what makes your App great:
        UI, design or HTML5 animations that wow your users.
        <br/><i>Just realize the truth: there is no back end!</i>
        <b><p/>
            So go ahead, make something amazing.
